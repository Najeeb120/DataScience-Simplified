What is a neural network?

The basic idea behind a neural network is to simulate (copy in a simplified but reasonably faithful way) lots of densely interconnected brain cells inside a computer so you can get it to learn things, recognize patterns, and make decisions in a humanlike way. The amazing thing about a neural network is that you don't have to program it to learn explicitly: it learns all by itself, just like a brain!

But it isn't a brain.
It's important to note that neural networks are (generally) software simulations: they're made by programming ordinary computers, working in a very traditional fashion with their ordinary transistors and serially connected logic gates, 
to behave as though they're built from billions of highly interconnected brain cells working in parallel.

No-one has yet attempted to build a computer by wiring up transistors in a densely parallel structure exactly like the human brain.


In other words, a neural network differs from a human brain in exactly the same way that a computer model of the weather differs from real clouds, snowflakes, or sunshine. 
Computer simulations are just collections of algebraic variables and mathematical equations linking them together (in other words, numbers stored in boxes whose values are constantly changing).
They mean nothing whatsoever to the computers they run insideâ€”only to the people who program them.
